<h2>What does it do?</h2>
It is a calculator! Very functional in every way you would want.<br><br>

But instead of giving you the answer like a normie- you get a memory address to search and retrieve your own answer like a TRUE superuser.<br><br>

We've followed the "less-is-more" philosophy to bring you the worlds first calculator without any clear button! <br>
Instead- because we know you crave nostalgia as much as us, there is a built-in etch-a-sketch inspited shake-to-clear function ü´®<br><br>

Meet our bottom row of best in class function buttons.<br>
- Up first, go even darker with DarkerMode‚Ñ¢Ô∏è.<br>
- Then if the average calculating experience isn't challenging you enough, try shuffle mode and keep shuffling to your heart's content.<br>
- And because we're nice people, a built in tool for looking up your memory address values by typing in or dragging and dropping the text right from the calculator's screen.<br><br>

Its not enough to only be the world's first in a 2 areas. I need 1 more.<br>
<em>So introducing the first digital calculator with a built in flip feature to do the one thing that technology has been preventing me from doing since i left Texas Instruments behind-</em><br>
(( Just be sure to type in the only numbers that make sense to make it happen! ))<br><br>
